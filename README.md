## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript Plugin - For Styles

### What I learned

I learned that using library plugins can help make a project faster and fix problems.</br>
In order to avoid overlapping with the background of my project, I had to change its background. However, I was unable to do this through the plugin code. The opacity property helped me and the result was the same as you see.

```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bubbly-bg@1.0.0/dist/bubbly-bg.js"></script>
    <script>bubbly();</script>
```
```css
#QR-bg{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to devote more time to resolving issues and mastering the fundamentals of JavaScript and the React framework.
