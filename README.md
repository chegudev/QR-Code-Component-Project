### Why did I code the project again ?

Well, the first time I coded this project, I actually didn't know much about HTML/CSS.
The presence of unnecessary files, excess in the appearance of the page, and the lack of standard structuring,
It made me decide to rebuild the project.

I realized that in order to show my creativity as a front-end developer, I don't necessarily need to add different and weird designs to the project; Rather, what can make me different from others in this profession is the use of tricks and tips that can have a positive effect on the way of structuring and even improving the efficiency of the project.
